Description: MM2S is single-sample classifier that generates Medulloblastoma (MB) subtype predictions for single-samples of human MB patients and model systems, including cell lines and mouse-models. The MM2S algorithm uses a systems-based methodology that faciliates application of the algorithm on samples irrespective of their platform or source of origin. MM2S demonstrates > 96% accuracy for patients of well-characterized normal cerebellum, WNT, or SHH subtypes, and the less-characterized Group4 (86%) and Group3 (78.2%). MM2S also enables classification of MB cell lines and mouse models into their human counterparts.This package contains function for implementing the classifier onto human data and mouse data, as well as graphical rendering of the results as PCA plots and heatmaps.
